# daslicht WordPress twentysixteen

This is a clone of the WordPress twentysixteen theme

I have modified the template theme hirachy and the used terminology to fit my needs and be more cosistent.

For example the original twentysixteen use the term *content_type* which are not existent in WordPress at all. 
I have used *post_type* instead
