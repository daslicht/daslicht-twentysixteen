# daslicht WordPress twentysixteen

> A hierarchical developer friendly WordPress theme 

This is a clone of the WordPress twentysixteen theme (with no child themeing in mind)

I have modified the template theme hirachy and the used terminology to fit my needs and be more cosistent.

For example the original twentysixteen use the term *content_type* which are not existent in WordPress at all. 
I have used *post_type* instead

see: 
[Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types)

## Basic Info
Instead of polluting the root of the Theme Folder, all files are stored hierarchical in folders.

There is only *ONE* Layout instead of including ```get_header();``` and ```get_footer();``` over and over again.  

`Template Tags` are solved as import as well and not with functions.
